Hey! 

I am happy that you're here : ] 
My name is Simon, and I am studying Information Technology. Right now I am interested in PHP a lot, especially I am using Laravel and learning about SPA. But also I'm working with python, bash or even Octave ðŸ˜†
Personally I am a bit gamer, a bit active person and also lazy couch burrito, just a bit ðŸ˜…
My DM is always open, so don't hesitate to text me ;)

Again, thanks that you are here!
Simon :>
